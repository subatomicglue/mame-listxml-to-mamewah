# Modern Mame to Legacy Mamewah list generator

Still using Mamewah for your frontend?  Me too! (at least today I am... who knows for how much longer I will)

Modern Mame (e.g. 0.223) outputs a xml list that is incompatible with the old mamewah list parser, so let's generate a mamewah list with a simple script!

## install:
```
npm install
```

## usage:
```
convert.js listxml.xml mamewah.lst
```
